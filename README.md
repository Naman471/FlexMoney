1. Kindly find the detailed plan inside the Documents folder with .docx extension
3. The main idea is to maintain 3 seperate tables for New_Enrollment, Batch_Changes, Payment for smooth functioning
4. The Batch_Shifting table would have the last_updated_month which shows which was the last month the user shifted his batch. It helps in keeping a track when did the user last changed his batch.
5. The Payment table would also have last_month_paid attribute to keep track for payment made for every month
